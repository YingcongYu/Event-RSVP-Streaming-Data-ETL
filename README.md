# Event RSVP-Project

### In this project, I did the followings:
##### Designed, developed, tested, and monitored the ETL process on Cloudera platform by applying Spark DataFrame API, Python, SQL, and Impala.
##### Generated random streaming data of RSVP by Python, and created Kafka topic, producer, and consumer to process the streaming data.
##### Scripted Spark DataFrame API in PySpark Shell to store events in HDFS in JSON format and parquet format with Schema, analyze streaming events in Tumbling and Sliding windows, insert data into a KUDU table, and check the output of each job.
##### Used Impala SQL to create a KUDU table and verify the inserted data from the streaming job.
